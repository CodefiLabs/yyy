title: Pre-flight Checklist
description: Creates a comprehensive checklist before starting a feature
---
Before we start building this feature, please create a comprehensive checklist of everything that needs to work completely before I can ship it.

Include:
- Core functionality requirements
- Edge cases to handle
- Error scenarios to test
- Performance considerations
- User experience requirements
- Integration points with existing code
- Testing requirements (unit, integration, e2e)
- Documentation needs
- Accessibility requirements
- Security considerations

Format this as a clear, actionable checklist I can verify before marking this feature as complete.
